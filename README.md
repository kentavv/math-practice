This program was made to help my son learn his arithmetic tables. Starting with traditional flashcards, we wondered if there were some problems that were consistently more difficult. This program tests the idea by recording the attempts and time required to solve each problem. After some data is collected, I'll update the program to include in the problems ones that were previously easy and hard (measured by time), to test if the problems remain easy or hard. While currently only set up for addition, if helpful, subtraction, multiplication, and division will be added, and more progress towards improving practice by including difficult problems. We tried TuxMath and GCompris, both are execellent. However, TuxMath may be distracting to a young person and neither appear adaptive, and neither track problem level progress.
